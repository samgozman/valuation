Classic DuPont 3 steps analysis\.

DuPont Analysis is a framework used to break apart the underlying components of the return on equity \(ROE\) metric to determine the strengths and weaknesses of a company\.

    IsAssetTurnoverUpTrend    bool // If AssetTurnover is rising most of the time during given periods
    IsEquityMultiplierUpTrend bool // If EquityMultiplier is rising most of the time during given periods
